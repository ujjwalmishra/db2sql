TODO for editing the code: 

1. Create default primary key column if not defined when creating tables. The index should auto-increment with each insert.

2. Update INSERT syntax. Requirement is INSERT INTO TABLE [(column_list)] table_name VALUES (value1,value2,value3, ...); 
    But the code accepts INSERT INTO table_name [(column_list)]  VALUES (value1,value2,value3, ...); 
    
3. Update DELETE syntax. Requirement is DELETE FROM TABLE table_name WHERE condition; 
    But the code accepts DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition; 

4. Create functions for CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX. 
   Syntax is not defined in requirements but it will create or remove an index on a single column of an existing table 
   (i.e., PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL).
